They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say \"black lives matter\", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter.  Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions.  This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities.

I'm gay.\" For many   parents first reaction probably will be \"How will I ever handle this?\" The  answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help  to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your  continued relationship with your son or daughter.   Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their  child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as  problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during  that time.   Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're  hearing (\"It's just a phase; you'll get over it\"); by shutting down (\"If you  choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it\"); or by not registering the  impact of what we're being told (\"That's nice, dear, and what do you want  for dinner?\").   Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If  you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you  would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept  secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.   It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because  homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment  for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of  telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through \"a phase\".   On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding  and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, \"Is  she/he sure?\" the answer will almost always be \"yes\"!

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service. Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban.  Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army.  He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska.  Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman.  But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!  America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity. Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war.  #Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega", "engagement": {"reactions": 0.0, "comments": 9.0, "shares": 36.0, "likes": 167.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0000162": {"clicks": "91", "creation_date": "07/16/15 01:45:49 AM PDT", "end_date": "07/17/15 01:45:49 AM PDT", "id": "640", "impressions": "865", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/", "spend": "299.93 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Location - Living In": "United States", "People Who Match": {"Friends of connections": "Friends of people who are connected to LGBT United"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Dykes On Bikes birthday is in July!

Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing  their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is  the biggest mistake!  When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about  homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about  being gay.

It's very powerful both for  straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and  people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs.

THINGS  HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF  The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he had a \u00b0medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.  On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.  An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate.  Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed.  We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after \"fighting\" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in police custody.", "engagement": {"reactions": 301.0, "comments": 27.0, "shares": 355.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0000400": {"clicks": "0", "creation_date": "10/09/15 05: 50:41 AM PDT", "end_date": "10/11 /15 01 :00:59 AM PDT ", "id": "1251", "impressions": "0", "landing_page": "https://instagram.com/black_america_news", "spend": "0.00", "targeting": {"Age": "16 - 65+", "Exclude Location": "United States: Washington", "Interests": "Politics or Politics and social issues", "Location": "United States: Washington", "Location - Living In": "United States: Washington (+50 mi) District of Columbia Exclude", "Placements": "lnstagram Feed"}, "text": "Americalnstotus", "engagement": {"reactions": 0.0, "comments": 0.0, "shares": 0.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0000402": {"clicks": "O", "creation_date": "10/09/15 08:04:33 AM PDT", "end_date": "10/11 /15 01 :00:59 AM PDT ", "id": "1252", "impressions": "O", "landing_page": "https://instagram.com/black_america_news", "spend": "0.00", "targeting": {"Age": "16 - 65+", "Exclude Location": "United States: Washington", "Interests": "Politics or Politics and social issues", "Language": "English (US)", "Location": "United States: Washington", "Location - Living In": "United States: Washington (+50 mi) District of Columbia Exclude", "Placements": "lnstagram Feed"}, "text": "Americalnstotus", "engagement": {"reactions": 0.0, "comments": 0.0, "shares": 0.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0000404": {"clicks": "256", "creation_date": "05/26/17 02:05:30 AM PDT", "end_date": null, "id": "1261", "impressions": "5,456", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/events/239129926564203/", "spend": "2,105.19 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "16 - 60", "And Must Also Match": {"Behaviors": "African American (US)", "Employers": "Gun Owners of America", "Industry": "Veterans (US)", "Interest expansion": "On", "Interests": "Right to keep and bear arms, The Second Amendment, National Rifle Association, Self-defense, Second Amendment Sisters, Gun Owners of America, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Concealed carry in the United States, Gun Rights, National Association for Gun Rights, Guns & Ammo or Gun Rights Across America,", "Job title": "Veteran,", "Multicultural Affinity": "African American (US)", "Politics": "Likely to engage with political content (liberal)"}, "Connections": "Exclude people who like United Muslims of America", "Excluded Connections": "Exclude people who like United Muslims of America", "Language": "English (UK) or English (US)", "Location - Living In": "United States: New York Excluded", "People Who Match": {"Interests": "Civil and political rights, Human rights, Anarchism, Nonviolence, Stop the War Coalition, Anti-fascism, Pacifism, Peace movement, The Anarchy, World peace, Anti-war movement, Feminism, PeaceOnEarth or Be a Peacekeeper - The World Peacekeepers Movement"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers, News Feed on mobile devices or Right column on desktop computers"}, "text": "If you don't want refugees, stop creating them!

We're organizing a peaceful gathering to draw public attention to the above- mentioned terrible problem. Our President and Congress must listen to those who granted them power - us, the people. If you also think that there should only be peace, come with us and let's make it happen.  Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Make peace, not war!

As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois\" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.  #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap", "engagement": {"reactions": 999.0, "comments": 999.0, "shares": 999.0, "likes": 999.0, "people_going": "999", "people_interested": "999", "people_like_this": "999", "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0000845": {"clicks": "1,074", "creation_date": "03/16/17 07:25:41 AM PDT", "end_date": "03/17/17 07:25:41 AM PDT ", "id": "2462", "impressions": "6,911", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence/", "spend": "400.00 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Location - Living In": "United States", "People Who Match": {"Interests": "Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Little black cutie!   #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness  #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america  #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #blackchildren #africanchildren  #baby #blackgirlmagic", "engagement": {"reactions": 995.0, "comments": 31.0, "shares": 53.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0000847": {"clicks": "178", "creation_date": "", "end_date": null, "id": "2470", "impressions": "4,059", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence/", "spend": "1,500.02 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "And Must Also Match": {"Behaviors": "African American (US)", "Employers": "Gun Owners of America", "Industry": "Veterans (US)", "Interest expansion": "On", "Interests": "Right to keep and bear arms, The Second Amendment, National Rifle Association, Self-defense, Second Amendment Sisters, Gun Owners of America, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Concealed carry in the United States, Gun Rights, National Association for Gun Rights, Guns & Ammo or Gun Rights Across America,", "Job title": "Veteran,", "Multicultural Affinity": "African American (US)", "Politics": "Likely to engage with political content (liberal)"}, "Connections": "Exclude people who like Black Excellence", "Excluded Connections": "Exclude people who like Black Excellence", "Language": "English (UK) or English (US)", "Location - Living In": "United States Excluded", "People Who Match": {"Interests": "Black Girls Rock!"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers, News Feed on mobile devices or Right column on desktop computers"}, "text": "Join us, if you proud to be who you are and believe that your roots give you   the power!

She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad!  Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected.

Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.

It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough, \"Sworn officer of the court\" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat.  The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation.  This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable?  We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over. Let's wait and keep our eyes open.

Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

According to St. Louis Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the suspect four times were about seven years on the force.  That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it?

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like \"Stop & Frisk\" or \"Broken Windows.\"  This is why I march.

The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.  One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an \"army\" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help.  It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word \"shooting\" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait.

Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to create a \"unity chain,\" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes in honor of the fallen. Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday's gathering, according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted \"Charleston strong!\"  Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons to sorrow over something day by day.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.  But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote \u2014 not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto \u2014 and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal.  Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress.

Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the war and its supporters.  In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C. There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during the war are inscribes.

The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration\u2014meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million.  Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies.  You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here.

After national debate over the relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka \"Bad cop, who killed innocent black child\" tried to go back to police work but was turned down because he's too big a liability.  In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, \"It's too hot an issue, so it makes me unemployable.\"  So what does the situation mean to America?  Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent. Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how upside-down society has become.  I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send teachers to jail for teaching?  Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him.

By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice.  Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior \"reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality.\"  The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community.

One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.  There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.  But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.  It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth.  Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth.

Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets.  That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent!  But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to \"work to overturn any Supreme Court decision\" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge.  Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen \u2014 and it already has in some states \u2014 so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it!  There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all.  They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable. And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes in shameful history \u2014 or more likely they'll be forgotten completely.  #LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality", "engagement": {"reactions": 999.0, "comments": 999.0, "shares": 999.0, "likes": 999.0, "people_going": "999", "people_interested": "999", "people_like_this": "999", "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0002574": {"clicks": "150", "creation_date": "06/23/15 07:04:59 AM PDT", "end_date": "06/24/15 07:04:59 AM PDT", "id": "656", "impressions": "1,484", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/", "spend": "368.34 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Location - Living In": "United States", "People Who Match": {"Friends of connections": "Friends of people who are connected to LGBT United"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "RUBY ROSE SHARING THOUGHTS ABOUT GENDER FLUIDITY.

Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty.

According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face.  The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame.  This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice?

According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind.  Slager's defense attorney's: \"The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.'  The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.  We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.", "engagement": {"reactions": 587.0, "comments": 119.0, "shares": 586.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0002861": {"clicks": "0", "creation_date": "10/18/16 06:57:05 AM PDT", "end_date": "10/19/16 06:57:04 AM PDT", "id": "1055", "impressions": "0", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/", "spend": "None", "targeting": {"Age": "16 - 65+", "Interests": "Pan-Africanism, African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Black (Color)", "Language": "English (UK) or English (US)", "Location": "United States", "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Don't forget Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, who founded the Black Panther  Party for Self-Defense in October 1966.", "engagement": {"reactions": 1500.0, "comments": 43.0, "shares": 766.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0002863": {"clicks": "172", "creation_date": "03/24/16 07:39:50 AM PDT", "end_date": "03/27/16 07:39:00 AM PDT", "id": "1058", "impressions": "3.245", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/events/607910082706490/", "spend": "1.000.00 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "16 - 54", "Language": "English (UK) or English (US)", "Location": "United States: Buffalo (+12 mi) New York", "People Who Match": {"Behaviors": "African American (US)"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Join us at Erie Center!

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014.  The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism.  Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress.  The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever since they returned to work; they have been subjected to petty attacks and denied attempts in promotion.  Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police department aggressively criticized their conduct.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez, brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi- Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.  The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held personally and financially responsible for their actions.  Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another attitude to people in blue?"}, "P(1)0003440": {"clicks": "200", "creation_date": "06/08/16 05:17:00 AM PDT", "end_date": "07/05/16 05:16:58 AM PDT", "id": "1430", "impressions": "6,274", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1342227815791954/", "spend": "3,387.07 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Interests": "African-American music, Black History Month or African-American history", "Location": "United States: Baltimore (+25 mi) Maryland", "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Last month, Edward M.

Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.  Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless.  The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.  The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.  To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law, it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their eyes.  It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it.

They do not try to shoot you, they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money.  When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.  The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car.  The suspect called his friend \"brown trash\" and told him he had to \"leave this country,\"  According to Usama's account, his friend responded: \"This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?\"  The incident \"escalated really quick,\" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down.  He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and screaming, \"We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!\"", "engagement": {"reactions": 999.0, "comments": 999.0, "shares": 999.0, "likes": 999.0, "people_going": "999", "people_interested": "999", "people_like_this": "999", "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0003651": {"clicks": "467", "creation_date": "10/18/16 02:27:41 AM PDT", "end_date": null, "id": "1611", "impressions": "9,300", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/", "spend": "3,423.46 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 -

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what?  Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: \"We came, we saw, he died\". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks.  You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world!  You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.  8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States.

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.  He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was accused of committing a felony.  Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot be filled.

This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as they can.  At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.  Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only hope for a better future!"}, "P(1)0004116": {"clicks": "3", "creation_date": "08/04/16 05:12:07 AM PDT", "end_date": "08/05/16 05:12:06 AM PDT", "id": "1962", "impressions": "18", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/Secured-Borders-757183957716200/", "spend": "493.22 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Location - Living In": "United States: Texas", "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Barack Hussein Obama has tried very hard to open the doors for his friends  from Middle East and to create a most welcoming environment for Muslims in general.

Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31 % cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government.

Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons.  Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26.  Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.  Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off \u2014 who she believed was a Chicago police officer \u2014 stopped and got out of their cars.  At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.  She said the man got inside his car but exited again and \"he just started shooting,\" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it.  Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him.  \"I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,\" said Boxley.  Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.  \"This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,\" - Tiffaney Boxley.  Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed.  #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice", "engagement": {"reactions": 999.0, "comments": 999.0, "shares": 999.0, "likes": 999.0, "people_going": "999", "people_interested": "999", "people_like_this": "999", "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0005756": {"clicks": "1,805", "creation_date": "01/31/17 03:19:56 AM PST", "end_date": "02/01/17 03:19:56 AM PST", "id": "3158", "impressions": "11.923", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/Woke-Blacks-294234600956431/", "spend": "300.00 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Interests": "Martin Luther King; Jr., African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Malcolm X", "Location - Living In": "United States", "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "That magic feeling when you rise up and remember that you are strong,  talented and Black.  #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOf Self lsANationaIity #EconomicEmpowerment #Integration Failed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence", "engagement": {"reactions": 2000.0, "comments": 20.0, "shares": 386.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0005758": {"clicks": "3,453", "creation_date": "01 /11/17 07:16:23 AM PST", "end_date": "01/12/17 07:16:23 AM PST", "id": "3160", "impressions": "25,089", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.comNVoke-Blacks-294234600956431/", "spend": "200.00 RUB", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Interests": "Martin Luther King, Jr., African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Malcolm X", "Location - Living In": "United States", "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices"}, "text": "Sometimes it takes just a simple gesture, an act of sharing and giving, simply  because you have more than enough.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it cant be torn down!  I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can protect our history!", "engagement": {"reactions": 16.0, "comments": 1.0, "shares": 3.0, "likes": 0.0, "people_going": 0, "people_interested": 0, "people_like_this": 0, "screened": 1.0}}, "P(1)0005841": {"clicks": "0", "creation_date": "12/08/16 03:58:11 AM PST", "end_date": null, "id": "3233", "impressions": "0", "landing_page": "https://www.facebook.com/Nefertitis-Community-576081822594619/", "spend": "None", "targeting": {"Age": "18 - 65+", "Connections": "Exclude people who like Nefertiti's Community", "Excluded Connections": "Exclude people who like Nefertiti's Community", "Language": "English (UK) or English (US)", "Location - Living In": "China Excluded", "People Who Match": {"Interests": "Pan-Africanism, Kemetism or Black Girls Rock!"}, "Placements": "News Feed on desktop computers, News Feed on mobile devices or Right column on desktop computers"}, "text": "If u love to be woke and u wanna improve ur knowledge of self, join our community!

For instance, one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in corrupted criminal justice system, next one in making racial justice as the centerpiece of the campaign as a strategy to have more black voters.  Doubtless, voting won't bring us safety and won't provide us an immediate conduit for our social well-being.

And  it is becoming dangerous.  So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.  \"He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,\" Mark Wilson said.  When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves.  Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to eliminate the party.

According to Lim, he saw the unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the woman tell Lim, \"Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything.\" And why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?  Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black people were treated disrespectfully!

She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad!  Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected.
