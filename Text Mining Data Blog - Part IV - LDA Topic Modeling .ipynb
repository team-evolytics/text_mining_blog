    "If you read our previous posts, you may remember that Evolytics was asked to analyze approximately 68,000 open-ended responses to nine survey questions.  These questions included asking survey participants to list competitor brands they had tried, rate the competitors, and describe their rationale for the rating. They also asked what the consumer liked about the brand and why they would recommend it.  In this post, we'll demonstrate how to create a topic model that summarizes the content of a large number of documents and how you might use this for further analysis. "

    "\n",
    "Topic modeling algorithms generate statistical models of a document collection (i.e., corpus) by grouping commonly co-occurring words together so that the themes, or \"topics\", are revealed.  Perhaps the most well-known topic modeling algorithm is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  I don't want to seem \"hand wavy\" but there are lots of articles and papers that discuss [how LDA works in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDq3OVp9dNA) and this is more of a practical demonstration.  Suffice to say, it is a Bayesian technique that assumes there are latent (i.e., hidden/unknown) topics that are represented by the corpus's vocabulary (i.e., the set of all modeled terms/tokens drawn from the documents).  In a gross simplification, the algorithm essentially iterates over the documents updating the probability regarding whether a given term belongs to a particular topic on each iteration.     \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two outputs of interest from LDA models.  First, it produces a set of topics which are defined as probability distributions of the corpus's vocabulary.  Each term from the corpus's vocabulary appears in every topic but an analyst would inspect the most probable terms to get some idea regarding the nature of the topic.  Second, LDA topic models produce a document X topic matrix showing the degree to which each topic characterizes a document.  Note that topic models *do not* classify documents!  Instead, it is assumed that documents are a proportion of all the model's topics.  This makes intuitive sense - a survey response might be *both* about a products aesthetics and it's build quality.  LDA represents this mix of topics proportionately.            "

    "A prevailing theory following the 2016 election cycle was that Russia's social media campaign was intended to help Donald Trump.  However, you'll notice that the Russian's were targeting segments of the population that generally leaned both liberal (e.g., black lives matter) and conservative (e.g., military veterans).  One interpretation of this pattern is that rather than trying to help a given candidate, the Russians were attempting to exploit social fractures in our society.  I would suggest the [University of Oxford's report on the 2016 disinformation campaign](https://demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2018/12/IRA-Report-2018.pdf) if you want additional details on the content and how these posts were identified. We're going to remain apolitical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than topic modeling the text of the posts, we're going to model the targeting criteria that the Russians used.  We're doing this for three reasons.  First, as previously noted, the Russians were making inflammatory and, in some cases, offensive posts which I don't want to amplify.  Second, using the targeting criteria highlights that we can use topic modeling with data other than traditional \"documents\" (e.g., surveys, webpages, books, reports, social media posts, etc.).  In fact, topic modeling has been used by [biologists to extract features from genome and protein-coding sequences](https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-3252-8).  Finally, topic modeling works best with a large number of long documents. Here we have a relatively small dataset but the ad targeting data has minimal overlap allowing us to detect better defined topics in small dataset."

As you might have noted, the targeting criteria is a nested dictionary so for each ad we simply get the values of that dictionary and build out a string for our document.  Pooling many short documents is a necessary step when your documents are not sufficiently long for LDA analysis and we can find [examples of this strategy in academic research](https://people.csail.mit.edu/davidam/assets/publications/2016_twitter_topic_modeling/ICWSM2016_Topic.pdf). However, you should have criteria that makes sense regarding what documents to pool.  In this case, any targeting criteria for a given ad is being pooled.    \n",

This is extremely important because it ensures replicability.  If it is unset, you will always get a slightly different model.  Second, LDA requires the number of topics to be specified. Below we'll talk about strategies to determine the number of topics.   "

    "#### How many topics should I have? \n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling relies, in part, upon the judgement of the researcher.  In general, you should select the number of topics that provides the greatest human interpretability.  However, it's not always clear the number of topics we should try first.  The [U_MASS measure of topic coherence](http://dirichlet.net/pdf/mimno11optimizing.pdf) considers how often the top words in a topic co-occur across documents. It assumes that random words, or words that do not co-occur with other top words in a topic, are indicators of poor topic coherence.        \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we created a function for fitting our topic model is so we can loop over it with different parameters.  Here we're fitting models with different numbers of topics and returning the topic coherence score. After calculating our topic coherence scores, we graph them for inspection.  The y axis is the UMASS score and the x axis is the number of topics. There is a bit of art here - you should generally go for a higher UMASS value (i.e., close to zero) but if after inspecting the topics they are difficult to interpret then you should consider other lower scored values.  Additionally, as a rule of thumb, I usually assume there are greater than 5 topics present (otherwise why model?).   Thus, I typically begin with the number of topics equal to or greater than five with the highest topic coherence score. In this case, that is eleven!    "

Note that you can set the number of documents it returns as well as the threshold for the topic score.  Higher thresholds mean that the document focuses more on a given topic (i.e., it's a purer representation of that topic).  The reason that we do this is to assist in interpretability - it can be easier to spot the commonalities in documents when looking at untokenized documents that are strong matches for a given topic."

    "Remember that each document (i.e., a Facebook ad's targeting criteria) is a mix of all topics in LDA!  This makes intuitive sense.  Afterall, you can target someone how engages with content representing a mix of the topics above (e.g., you can imagine a segment that cares about both US policing and civil rights).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our Document X Topic matrix (i.e., dtm) has a row for each document (in this case a Facebook ad) and a column for each topic.  The values for a given row represent the percent each topic is present in that document.  Intuitively, if you sum across the topics, you should get approximately 1.00 or 100% (plus or minus some rounding). In contrast, when you sum the columns of the documents (i.e., the topics) it is not immediately interpretable. However, we can convert this to a percent value by dividing it by the number of documents.  This tells us the percentage to which each topic was discussed in the corpus.  This is useful if you want to visualize the prevalence of topics in a document or the corpus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the number of documents for each topic you must set a threshold and then count the number of documents whose score exceeds it. For example, if you set a value of .33 (i.e., 33 percent allocation to a given topic) then documents can at most be bucketed into 3 topics but probably no more than 2.  However, some documents are never going to reach that threshold for any topic. In other words, the counts will not equal the total of your sample."

    "\n",
    "In this post we've demonstrated how to create and evaluate topic models. I've also provided guidance regarding how to interpret the output of such models. However, you can go even further! For example, using our list of dictionary keys we can join this back to the original dataset and inspect the ads start and end dates to learn how the Russian ad targeting evolved over time. We can also look at which topics received the most engagement by users, what the Russian ad spend was on each topic, or even what the ROI was (they spent shockingly little)! And, of course, we can create visualizations for all of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't forgotten that we started this series explaining how we analyzed open responses to a client’s survey. To be clear I used similar techniques to do so. Specifically, I pooled similar questions together since open responses are short, I checked for duplicates to eliminate spam, and I used topic coherence to suggest how many topics were present. Our results provided value to our client that they would not have gotten by simply cherry-picking answers from the survey. Not only did they learn thematically what their consumers were saying but they learned the prevalence of those themes in the responses.\n",
